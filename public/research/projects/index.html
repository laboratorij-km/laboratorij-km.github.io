Machine learning is a data-driven field, which needs massive computing resources. Quantum computation, on the other hand, can provide exponential speedups for some classical algorithms. Therefore, it is natural to combine the strengths of both fields to solve outstanding problems in industry and research. The project has three goals. The first goal is to use machine learning methods for the description of many-body quantum systems. In this part of the project, we will tackle some of the notable problems of many-body quantum mechanics with new tools that are emerging by adopting neural networks to quantum mechanical problems. The second goal is to use methods from many-body quantum mechanics to describe machine learning problems. We will address the problems of adversarial examples, uncertainty, and generalization from a new perspective, which is motivated by the success of tensor networks for a description of many-body quantum systems. The third and most ambitious goal is to combine the knowledge from quantum mechanics and machine learning to find novel applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices with significant speedups for known classical algorithms. We will apply a combination of successful quantum-mechanical tools and advanced machine learning tools to find useful quantum algorithms that could demonstrate applied quantum advantage.</p>

Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting people worldwide. In addition to motor symptoms, Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients all experience a range of other symptoms, including psychological, cognitive, and behavior problems, which affect the quality of life of the patients and their families. Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is a chronic disease, whose management is directed towards the treatment of the underlying symptoms.<br>
The project focuses on discovering groups of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients through the development and application of advanced multi-view clustering approaches. The detection of groups of patients who share similar symptoms at the time of diagnosis and similar patterns of disease progression is an important step towards the development of personalized treatment PD patients. The second phase of the project consists of the development of an interactive tool for visualization of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease patients&rsquo; longitudinal status and their respective treatments.</p>

<hr>
<p>Recently, the use of deep neural networks significantly increased success of artificial intelligence approaches in natural language, from speech recognition to machine translation and text understanding tasks such as sentiment analysis. However, the success of deep learning relies on the availability of large annotated datasets in the language and domain required. Most modern machine learning models for language processing use word embeddings: representations of words not as symbols but as vectors of numerical values. These vectors encode important information about word meaning, and can preserve semantic relations between words, and this is even true across languages: word embedding spaces exhibit similar structures across languages. By aligning independently produced embeddings from monolingual text resources, we get a common cross-lingual representation, which allows for fast and effective integration of information in different languages. This cross-lingual mapping therefore provides great potential for less-resourced languages: machine learning tools can be developed using one language’s resources, but can operate on another. In Europe, advanced natural language research and resources exist for a few dominant languages (English, French, German), while many of EU smaller language communities—and the news media industry that serves them—lack appropriate tools. The EMBEDDIA project seeks to address these challenges by leveraging innovations in the use of cross-lingual embeddings coupled with deep neural networks to allow existing monolingual resources to be used across languages. In three years, the project’s six academic and four industry partners will develop novel solutions for under-represented languages, and test them in real-world news and media production contexts.</p>

<hr>
<p>The main research topic of the programme is modern Slovene, considered especially from the point of view of rapid digitization of languages and new developments in ICT. The objective of the programme is to conduct research into the specifics of Slovene and enable the development of resources and technologies according to international standards taking. The programme is interdisciplinary - in addition to linguistics, it includes computer and information sciences (language technologies) and education (literacy). The programme is conducted by experienced researchers of the Centre for Language Resources and Technologies at the University of Ljubljana (CJVT UL). Research covers five areas: language description, standardization, language technologies, terminology, and multilinguality. These areas cover all levels of description (text linguistics, semantics, syntax, morphology, phonology), focusing on holistic exploration of language phenomena. The research is empirical, based on real language data found in contemporary corpora and similar resources. In the fields of terminology and multilinguality the programme also covers research into the contact between Slovene and other languages, in order to facilitate the development of multilingual resources and technologies (e.g. for machine translation). Research methodology is rooted in state-of-the-art methods of machine learning and data mining, used for other languages under the theoretical framework of computational and corpus linguistics.</p>

<p>The goal of the project is to develop quality metrics for Slovene primary and secondary school textbooks to be used during their certification and evaluation. Our research group will develop a prototype of the automatic web-based tool, which will allow evaluation of textbooks based on their textual and pictorial properties. The tool will support decision-making process for selection of appropriate textbook. We will adapt, develop and implement several readability metrics for the Slovene language. We will use techniques from natural language processing, machine learning and image recognition to assess readability and text coherence. The decision support will be implemented through a hierarchical multi-parameter decision model, which will be flexible enough to capture requirements of different areas (social, humanistic and natural sciences), different age groups, education levels, special needs of pupils etc. The developed tool will be calibrated and evaluated on a sample of human evaluated textbooks. The tool will be open-sourced and publicly available.</p>

<hr>
<p>The goal of the project is development of intelligent system that can improve detection of human cognitive and behavior disorders. Example is dementia - the loss of intellectual functions, accompanied with personality disturbances (its most common form is the Alzheimer disease) and deterioration of individual’s quality of personal and professional life. Through the last decades, an abundance of medical data was gathered about dementia. These data include multimedia objects (images, sound, etc.), temporal data and time-series, and text documents; their analyses require state-of-the-art methods from the fields of data analysis. The expected project contributions include a prototype of the prediction system for analysis of disorders that will be generalized for several related health problems (such as Brain ischemia, Brain haemorrhagia, Brain tumors, Neurodegenerative disorders etc.) and evaluating the prototype on the available dementia data acquired from the Neurological (Novi Sad) and Oncological institute (Ljubljana).</p>

<hr>
<p>The coronary artery disease, also known as ischemic heart disease, frequently results in a heart attack and is the most common cause of death globally. Ischemia (a restriction in blood supply to tissues) is generally caused by problems with blood vessels with resultant damage and dysfunction of tissue. Currently, the application of state-of-the-art Finite Element Methods (FEM) ischemia modelling techniques in urgent clinical situations, such as alerting patient in case of ischemia, is not possible as it requires knowledge of patient-specific anatomy which requires long measurements. We will develop a two¬step solution which alleviates these problems: 1. creation of large virtual FEM based database, 2. detection of ischemic beats and prediction of ischemia location using the developed database and data mining. The final solution will select classifiers, which are successful in detecting ischemic pulses based on potentials measured on the body surface (i.e., ECG), which will allow fast ischemia detection in urgent situations. If the ECG is classified as ischemic by the first stage classifier, it will be processed by the second stage data mining model, which will predict the location of the ischemic area.</p>

<hr>
<p>Gigafida is a reference corpus of Slovene language containing Slovene texts from daily newspapers, magazines, all sorts of books, web pages, parliamentary speeches transcripts etc., all together around 1.2 billion words in 40,000 documents. It is a basis for balanced corpus Kres, and freely available corpora ccGigaFida and ccKres. Currently these corpora contain documents created until 2012. More information about the corpora is available at <a href="http://www.slovenscina.eu/korpusi/">http://www.slovenscina.eu/korpusi/</a>.</p>
<p>The project to upgrade these corpora has three goals: collecting new materials, machine processing of new and existing documents, and public availability of upgraded corpora, their distribution and public dissemination. The collection of new materials is going to focus on currently underrepresented texts (like textbooks and other primary and secondary schools materials), news portals and daily newspapers. The aim is to increase the Gigafida corpus to 1.5 billon words. Machine processing shall automatically tag all the documents in a uniform way and store them in a standardized format. The documents will be deduplicated. The updated corpuses will be publicly available through concordancers in CLARIN infrastructure and presented to general public and professional community.</p>

<hr>
<p>In practice, m-learning is not necessarily tied to a classroom, students and teaching, but also to alternative forms of knowledge acquisition, such are also tourist applications for discovering unseen places. Within the project titled Tourist guide based on the “Treasure hunt” game the students have developed an educational game FRIStep (based on its predecessor, game Geostep). The game is based on a principle of »treasure seek«, where the »hidden treasure« is represented by an educational riddle that educates the player about various facts (e.g. about sights and places to see). Within the project, the basic game was upgraded with multilingual support, knowledge evaluation and scoring, use of artificial intelligence for recommending the most appropriate game, different game types and a modern user interface.</p>

<p>One of the civilization responsibilities is the need for increasing the quality of life for blind and weaksighted people using the modern technology. Daily activities which for healthy subjects seem to be trivial, such as finding the required destination, using various objects, safe navigation through complex paths, recognizing the local environment and an appropriate orientation in it, contextual comprehension of the environment etc. are much demanding and often unsolvable tasks for blind or weaksighted subject. Most of the approaches to solve those problems are based on GPS technology combined with inertial sensors and cameras. A basic limitation is information complexity of unmarked environments which can be avoided by providing a small number of useful data with respect to the current position, orientation and activity that a blind or weaksighted subject wants to perform (such as crossing the road). We expect that the use of machine learning methods, i.e. supervised and unsupervised learning on imbalanced datasets with combination of GPS, inertia sensors, cameras and an audiorendering system, will successfully solve the problems when using the existing approaches for helping during movement of blind and weaksighted people.</p>
<p>The goal of the proposed project is the development of appropriate machine learning algorithms that form the basis for future development of a modular mobile navigation system which will enable the blind and weaksighted people to autonomously, safely and accurate movement in known and unknown environments.</p>

<p>Cancer research is currently one of the leading fields of clinical research. One major issue in this field is cancer classification for accurate diagnosis and treatment and the other is utilizing an increasing amount of microarray raw data available. Up to now, majority of cancer classification studies were based on the patients overall clinical picture including histological findings at the tissue level, causing very limited diagnostic precision. Many existing tumor classes are heterogeneous, molecularly distinct and follow different clinical courses. Therefore, a differential diagnosis among a group of histologically similar cancers poses a challenging problem in clinical medicine.<br>
An extensive use of DNA microarray technology for characterization of cellular processes is leading to an increasing amount of microarray data from cancer studies. Today, there exists a tremendous amount of array data available; however, much of it remains as raw and only a small percent of its potential is being utilized. Cancer classification based on gene expression analysis derived from microarray data is a way to utilize this raw data in order to get the most accurate cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>The task of the project is to prepare an experimental data set describing patients with known cancer type and known exon mutations, to supplement this databases with negative examples (healthy patients) and additionally enhance it using the controlled sampling. Such enhanced database will be analysed with machine learning algorithms.</p>

<p>Mobile learning (m-learning) is developing rapidly in the world as the use of mobile devices is becoming popular and accessible financially and technologicaly. At the end of 2012, there were more than 6,8 billion mobile users in the world, which comprises 96% of the world population (source: The International Telecommunication Union, 2013). The contemporary way of living allows to be persistenlty connected to Internet, which enables students to seek for untraditional learning environments: dislocated from the classrooms, flexible in time, ubiquitously available and tailored to advances in technology. However, regardless of the development strategies for the period up to the year 2016, in practice, development of m-learning applications is based mostly on the enthusiasm of individual educational institutions or teachers. In this bilateral cooperation we propose to establish the first standard theoretical/educational framework for development of game-based learning and to develop and evaluate a set of such sample game-based learning applications.</p>

<hr>
<p>An important task of the electricity distribution companies is to forecast the electrical load (demand) for a given sub-network of consumers, as this is a relevant for identification of critical points and making decisions to buy or sell energy. From a data mining perspective, this problem is characterized by a large number of variables (data from the electrical sensors), produced in a continuous flow in a dynamic non-stationary environment. Standard prediction techniques in such circumstances fail and more complicated dynamic models are required – models that evolve over time and are able to adapt to changes in the distribution generating examples. Besides only forecasting the electricity load, the prediction should also contain an explanation of the phenomenon and the quality of the predictor must be clearly assessed with prediction reliability estimates in order to support user’s final decision.</p>
<p>In the framework of the project, the both research groups will aim to develop decision explanation methodology for concept drift detection in data stream learning, develop and test reliability estimates suitable for data streams, develop online summarization techniques for electrical time series, and study the utility of reliability estimates and decision explanations in data streams. The deliverables will ensure better predictions and robust decisions in electrical network management.</p>

<p>Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the world&rsquo;s most frequent causes of mortality and an important problem in medical practice. It is disease where one, two or all three coronary arteries are narrowed or obstructed mainly by atherosclerotic plaque(s). The consequence is diminished blood supply causing diminished oxygen supply of the dependent region of the myocardium, manifesting as angina pectoris. The most extreme consequences are myocardial infarction and cardiac death.</p>
<p>The object of project is collaboration in deployed plaque characterization algorithms and the patient-specific prediction model which can be enhanced with knowledge accumulated by heterogeneous data and resources. Blood element concentrations (e.g. LDL/HDL), patient medical condition (e.g. diabetic, hypertension), and patient habitual behavior (e.g. smoking/no smoking, exercising/no exercising) will be correlated with features extracted from patient’s medical images (e.g. MRI) and used for plaque characterization. The corresponding data will be situated in different repositories and even different systems. Both research groups will implement the treatment support system that will improve quality of medical services by providing cardiologists with suggestions on the best possible treatment scenario. The high-end expert system has a potential of application in medical practice (cardiology).</p>

<p>An important group of methods solving these problems is based on constructing ensembles of base learners. Bagging, boosting, random forests, and their variants are the most popular examples of this methodology and due to their classification strength and efficiency they belong to the state-of-the-art methods in classification and regression. When constructing an efficient prediction model these methods evaluate the predictive power of descriptive attributes and construct recursive partitioning of the problem space. The aim of our cooperation is to develop and test a new class of distance-based and uniform distribution based attribute evaluation measures which are better suited to the problem of imbalanced class distribution. Additionally we will investigate their multiclass extensions. For testing the proposed methods we will design complex artificial data sets for testing wide range of types of configurations of regions with different classification. The developed attribute evaluation measures will be used in state-of-the-art learning system based on random forests.</p>
<p>The above scientific goals need fast and efficient data mining algorithms and good exploratory data analysis tools. In data mining community the open-source R statistical environment is getting more and more attention for its wide applicability, availability, ease of use and good visualization capabilities. It is our aim in this project to develop new machine learning algorithms in this environment and therefore make it ready available for further scientific and commercial exploitation.</p>
<p>We are expecting that this joint research proposal will produce valuable research and practical results that will be of interest to the data mining and machine learning community and practitioners solving complex problems involving imbalanced data sets, e.g., in medicine, engineering, finance, public sector, etc.</p>

<p>Usually machine learning algorithms provide only bare predictions (classifications) for new unclassified examples (test cases). While there are ways for almost all machine learning algorithms to at least partially provide quantitative assessment of the particular classification, so far there is no general method to assess the quality (confidence, reliability) of the classification decision made for a new case. In this collaborative research project we elaborated on the very important issues of how to assess the performance of a classifier on a single case and not on the average performance for a certain set of cases and solved some of the problems so that the method became closer to generally applicable method.</p>

<p>Many important practical problems from intelligent data analysis assume that all outcomes are not equally important i.e., that they have different costs assigned. The inductive learning with this assumption is currently a hot research topic.</p>
<p>Algorithms Relief are among the best algorithms for attribute estrimation. They were successfully used in many machine learning tasks. So far these algorithms are not adapted for cost-sensitive classifiication and such an adaptation together with its implementation in a system for intelligent data analysis significantly improved the success of solving the cost sensitive problems. With this project we will analysed various extensions and adaptations of ReliefF algorithm for cost sensitive intelligent data analysis. Theoretical derivations and analyses were implemented in the open source system for intelligent data analysis which we adapted for cost sensitive problems. We tested the solutions on several artificial and real world problems</p>
